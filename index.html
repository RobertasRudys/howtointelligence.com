      A quick Google search will lead you to these descriptions from Wikipedia for <b>"Data"</b> terms:
    </h3>

    <li>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">Data Science</a>

      <p>
        "Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes,
        algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and
        unstructured data, and apply knowledge from data across a broad range of application
        domains."
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis">Data Analysis</a>

      <p>
        "Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modelling
        data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions,
        and supporting decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
        Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques
        under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social
        science domains.
      </p>

      <p>
        In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more
        scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively."
      </p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining">Data Mining</a>

      <p>
        "Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data
        sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and
        database systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics
        with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from
        a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for
        further use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Data mining is the analysis step of the "knowledge discovery in databases" process,
        or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data
        management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations,
        interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered
        structures, visualization, and online updating."
